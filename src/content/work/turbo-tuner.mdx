The ST-300 is a strobe tuner guitar pedal with 5 programmable presets for alternate tunings. It has
a USB port for customizing settings via a text file in the
[ST-300 Editor](https://www.turbo-tuner.com/usb/).

I built this web form to improve the text file editing experience. It includes controls for number
of strings, note and octave, cent offsets, A4 reference pitch, and transpose semitones with range
limits for each based on the [manual](https://www.turbo-tuner.com/media/ST300mini_Manual.pdf).

A settings text file can be imported and exported so it can then be opened in the ST-300 Editor
application and uploaded to the tuner.
