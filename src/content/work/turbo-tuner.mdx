![Turbo Tuner Settings Editor](/work/turbo-tuner.webp)

The ST-300 is a strobe tuner guitar pedal with five programmable presets for alternate tunings. It
has a USB port for customizing settings via a text file in the
[ST-300 Editor](https://www.turbo-tuner.com/usb/) desktop application.

The purpose of this web form is to improve the settings text file editing experience. It includes
controls for number of strings, note and octave, cent offsets, A4 reference pitch, and transpose
semitones with range limits for each based on the
[manual](https://www.turbo-tuner.com/media/ST300mini_Manual.pdf).

A settings text file can be imported and exported so it can then be opened in the ST-300 Editor
application and uploaded to the tuner.
