Responsible for user interface elements, including cylindrical paginated thumbnail grid, video
detail view with play and back buttons, video player controls with replay, play / pause, resolution
and back buttons, and timeline seek bar. The text is rendered with signed distance field bitmap
fonts . I also added support for stereoscopic VR headsets with the WebVR API and added supported for
VR controllers with the Gamepad API.
