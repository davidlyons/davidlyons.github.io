        Hi, my name is David and I create interactive 3D web graphics.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a 3D artist, design engineer and front end web developer with over 10 years of
        experience, I collaborate with cross-disciplinary teams to translate 2D concept art into
        real-time 3D models and animations, and translate static UX designs into clean, functional,
        responsive and accessible HTML, SCSS and Javascript.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-12">
        While my current favorite tools include Three.js, React, VS Code, Blender and ZBrush, my
        understanding of the fundamental concepts can transfer to any application, and I'm always
        learning, experimenting and exploring new ways to combine my creative and technical skills.
